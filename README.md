# Instagram_Impressions_Analysis
This Project discusses how to employ machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and predict the reach of Instagram posts. It emphasizes the importance of data analysis for content creators aiming for long-term success on the platform. The integration of data science in social media management is highlighted as a crucial tool..

#Data
Data needed and used in this project is added to the repository.

In this project, our goal is to study Instagram data, which we've gathered from this website: https://statso.io/instagram-reach-analysis-case-study/.

This data comes from the founder of Statso's Instagram account. This Instagram data was collected from a Business Instagram account and will have more insights to analyze rather than a personal instagram account. To get a better grasp of this information, we can look at specific aspects of it:

    Impressions: This tells us how many times a post was seen (its reach).
    From Home: It shows how many views the post got from users' home feeds.
    From Hashtags: It reveals the number of views that came from using hashtags.
    From Explore: This is the count of views generated from the Explore feature.
    From Other: It accounts for views from various other sources.
    Saves: This tells us how many times a post was saved by users.
    Comments: It's the total number of comments received on a post.
    Shares: It counts how many times the post was shared.
    Likes: This represents the number of users who liked the post.
    Profile Visits: It shows how many users visited the post author's profile from that post.
    Follows: This indicates how many users followed the account due to the post.
    Caption: It's the text accompanying the post.
    Hashtags: These are the hashtags used in the post.

The main objectives are to understand how Instagram's algorithm functions and to analyze how far-reaching (in terms of impressions) each post is within the provided Instagram account.
